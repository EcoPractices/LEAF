*************  GUI_ACCESS  ******************
* Steps:
* 1) Add an identifier and display text here
*    Name related items in the display text so that they sort contiguously.
* 2) For menu items, add to the struct cmd_pairs[] in "mainfrm.cpp".
*    (handy to copy resource id's from the rusle.rc file to reduce chance of mispelling)
* 3) Add a paramater listing in the "GUI_ACCESS" section of CatalogSharedParams().
* 4) usage example: App.pAccess->IsParamVisible("GUI_ADMIN_SHOW_LIST")
