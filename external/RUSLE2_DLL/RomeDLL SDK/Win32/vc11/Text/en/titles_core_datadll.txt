** Translation string (title) map for Rusle2 (www.rusle2.org). **
** This file is part of the Rusle2 distribution.               **
** See "Rusle2 Translation Titles.rtf" for more information.   **
*****************************************************************

** This file contains titles which appear in the DataDLL.

************************************************************************************
**	Messages used by the datadll.
**	Use with fns Message("KEY") or GetTitle("KEY").
**	Keys start with a standard 3-letter prefix, then are followed by a standard
**	  category name, then a description.
**
**	The 4 standard prefixes correspond to the icon type in a message box:
**  All datadll strings are followed by DATADLL_ (Ex: ERR_DATADLL_...)
**	ERR_		Error message box.
**	QST_		Question message box.
**	INF_		Info message box.
**	WRN_		Warning message box.
**
**	STR_		Translatable string not directly in a message box.
**
**	Some critical messages are hard-coded into a table in Rusle2 to guarantee that
**	  they are available at runtime. Search on ERR_FILE_MISSING to find the list.
