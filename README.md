# LEAF
Landscape Environmental Assessment Framework

*This project is not currently supported by Idaho National Laboratory as production grade software but is being made available to the public. Please use at your own risk.*

LEAF Version 2.0 is a framework comprising of three models RUSLE2, WEPS, and AGNPS. The framework can predict row crop, crop residue, and energy crop yields at a sub-field resolutions for various combinations of soil, climate and crop management and residue harvesting practices. It estimates the loss of soil, carbon, and nutrients to the atmosphere, to the groundwater, and to runoff. It also models the overland flow of water and washed-off sediments, nutrients and other chemicals to provide estimates of sediment, nutrient, and chemical loadings to water bodies within a watershed. AGNPS model and wash-off calculations are the new additions to this version of LEAF.

The purpose of this tool is to enable crop producers to improve their profitability by making informed choices of land and crop management practices by growing a combination of row and energy crops and harvesting row crop residues.
